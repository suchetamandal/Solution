Coding part of this feeling only 4 questions this year? Window sum, rectangle overlap, longest palindrome, k closest points.

Part I Work Simulation. Gave two hours, 30-60 minutes can be done. Links that are not very detailed, but the basic are reading questions, a small part of the test logic of the debug.
Part II Coding for 70 minutes. The first question Window Sum, the second question Find K nearest point. K nearest point link to the priority of the sort order to change. There is this question return empty list and return null I made a mistake so a test case has been difficult to come after the check out.
The third part is Coding for 30 minutes. Highest Five Scores. Known student id and test scores, to return a map with average of highest five scores for each student.



OA2 next day I received. . Waral Ti argon  chain Qun stagnant water still water Dong Jin Ku,
OA2 still the same, in front of a working simulation, first The second part is a three-question coding.
Behind the three problems of coding should be the old nine questions, say it again: window sum, overlap rectangle, Deep Copy linkedlist
K nearest point, longest palindrome substring, high little scores, minimum spanning tree, -google 1point3acres
company tree, order dependency.

Landowners encounter window sum, k nearest point, order dependency.
Basically are seconds off, we brush a few times, proper. Pay attention to write comments better.
